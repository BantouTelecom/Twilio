== Welcome to Twilio Demos with Ruby on Rails

This is a rails app that implements some Twilio Demos http://www.twilio.com/docs/demos

== What is Twilio?

http://www.twilio.com/how-twilio-works

Kind of a virtual PBX for web developers. 

* I think of it as Asterisk (http://www.asterisk.org/) without the necessary hardware/software setup 
* And a (surprisingly easily) programmable interface through REST/XML

== Getting started

* Sign up for a free Twilio account
* clone this app
#> git clone git@github.com:voodoo/Twilio.git
* Rename twilio.example.yml to twilio.yml
* Copy your AccountSid and AuthToken from your Twilio account into twilio.yml

== That is it

Fire up the app and open it in the browser for more info and web links to each demo app (including a switchboard) to 
access them from a phone

For developing, you need to have this on a public server

Rather than git push'ing every time I configure my router to forward my public ip to my local machine using port forwarding

To test on the phone, you will need this url set in your Account section on Twilio 

Mine looks something like this

http://my_public_ip:3000/twilio/board

== More

I avoided using any dependencies because I wanted this demo to be simple to setup

But it was hard in a way because I would have liked to have used a couple of gems like the following

* http://github.com/webficient/twilio/tree/master
** Which a nice gem for programatically generating xml with Twilio classes
** I decided to keep it out for now and expose things with xml builder so the details would not be hidden
* Some sort of yaml config
