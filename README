== Welcome to Twilio Demos

This is a rails app that implements some Twilio Demos http://www.twilio.com/docs/demos/


== What is Twilio?

http://www.twilio.com/how-twilio-works


Kind of a virtual PBX for web developers. 

I think of it as Asterisk (http://www.asterisk.org/) without the necessary hardware/software setup and programmable w/REST commands.

Fire up the app and go to the home page for more info

== Getting started

* Sign up for a free Twilio account
* Rename twilio.example.yml to twilio.yml
* Copy your AccountSid and AuthToken from your Twilio account
